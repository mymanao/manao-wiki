Guess what? Manao now **supports Kick**! 🎉  
O streamers of the realm, come forth and use my bot, I beg you.

You’ll need at least **Manao version 4.0.0** to use this feature.  
If you haven’t updated yet, go update first.

This guide will walk you through everything from A to Z — from initial setup all the way to using commands on Kick.

Before we continue, this guide assumes that you have already installed ManaoBot and have it running.  
If not, go read the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/00-getting-started/) first.

Alright. Ready?

Let’s go.

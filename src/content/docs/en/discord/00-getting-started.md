Since version 3.0.0, ManaoBot now has built-in Discord integration! This guide will teach you how to make ManaoBot running,
connect to your Discord server, and use Discord commands to control ManaoBot. This guide assumes you already have ManaoBot set up and running.
If not, please go back and read the [Getting Started Guide](/en/guides/00-getting-started/) first!
